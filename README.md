# VITogether

### About
After the FFCS, it can be difficult for students to get to know and connect to their new classmates. VITogether is a webapp that solves this problem by connecting all the students in the same class. This is done by enabling students to use this project as a common portal to share invite links to various class groups on different messaging apps like whatsapp, discord, telegram,. And, the rest of the class can access the link to join the groups of thier classes.
